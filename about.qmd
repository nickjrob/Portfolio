My name is Nick Robison, I am a senior majoring in applied data analytics with a concentration in information security. I am currently an Army ROTC cadet and am hoping to be an active duty cyber officer. ROTC has given me some experience in writing memos. Outside of school I enjoy travelling and reading.
