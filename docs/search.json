    "text": "To the Human Trafficking Institute\nI am an Army ROTC cadet in my senior year at Syracuse University and I am writing to advocate for stronger education on human trafficking for ROTC cadets and to explore opportunities for partnership between the Human Trafficking Institute (HTI) and Syracuse University. As ROTC cadets we will soon begin our careers as leaders where we will be entrusted with the lives and well-being of our soldiers, and it is imperative that we are prepared to recognize, respond to, and lead efforts that combat human trafficking in all its forms.\nHuman trafficking is not confined to the United States, it is a parasite that thrives where leaders lack the awareness and tools to intervene. Being at the beginning of our careers, this early exposure and education will help us in safeguarding vulnerable populations in addition to equipping us with the ability to instill the same awareness and vigilance into the soldiers we lead. By incorporating trafficking awareness and response into our curriculum we can ensure that our Army leaders will be prepared to combat traffickers and their effort both in the United States and abroad.\nHTI’s mission of decimating human trafficking by stopping it through law enforcement aligns with the army values of fighting all enemies, foreign and domestic. By establishing a connection with Syracuse University, HTI has the opportunity to empower future leaders to carry on the mission of building a future where traffickers are afraid not only in the U.S. but anywhere in the world. Together, I propose initiatives such as guest lectures (in person or via zoom) or workshops that provide actionable steps and tools for identifying trafficking and engagement with the broader Syracuse student body, especially the Student Veteran Organization (SVO), an upstanding and driven community that would bring valuable skills to any organization, especially HTI.\nThis partnership would be invaluable to not only Syracuse ROTC cadets and students but also HTI. By working with Syracuse University HTI will cultivate a community of impassioned leaders and professionals who will amplify HTI’s impact by bringing awareness and tools to several careers spanning from lawyers to sports management.\nMy passion for working against human trafficking is recent and with that I recognize the need for more expert voices, such as those at HTI. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with you. Thank you for your time and commitment to service.\nRespectfully,\nNick Robison\nSyracuse University\nArmy ROTC Cadet"

    "text": "LTC Coyne,\nI am writing to advocate for further education on and engagement on the issue of human trafficking for the Army ROTC program at Syracuse University. As future leaders in our Army it is imperative that we are cognizant of the signs of human trafficking, understanding its many forms, and learning how to lead soldiers in preventing exploitation, and responding to and supporting the victims of trafficking.\nHuman trafficking is a complex and pervasive threat. Human trafficking is defined as taking a person via force, fraud, or coercion and exploiting them for a commercial or personal benefit. Under this definition, human trafficking includes things such as sex trafficking (which people often picture when asked about trafficking), labor trafficking, and organ trafficking. This is relevant to the Army because these situations can directly threaten soldiers and the operational security of our units and missions especially due to the sensitive nature and propensity for blackmail associated with sex trafficking and its adjacent crimes such as sexual exploitation.\nThis issue goes deeper than just personal relevance to soldiers. First, involvement in trafficking is illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and undermines the readiness and discipline of soldiers and units. Second, trafficking operations are often used to fund or otherwise support terrorist groups that directly threaten our national security (https://humantraffickingsearch.org/human-trafficking-and-the-taliban/). Third, our Army conducts humanitarian and stability missions around the globe. This means our soldiers are likely to encounter trafficking victims and by enhancing our collective ability to recognize and assist victims as well as investigate and facilitate the end of human trafficking around the world builds a foundation of trust with local communities that strengthens U.S. credibility abroad.\nTo address these challenges we must go beyond the annual training for soldiers. I respectfully request to organize these opportunities for cadets to engage directly with professionals and subject matter experts. I have done a preliminary investigation of three options. These options are a guest lecture, a workshop, or a discussion.\nI would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet and discuss whether integrating one of these opportunities into our ROTC activities is possible and if so which type of opportunity is most feasible.\nRespectfully,\nNicholas Robison\nCDT, U.S. Army\nSyracuse Army ROTC\nEmail: nrobison@syr.edu\nPhone: (509) - 432 - 6803"
