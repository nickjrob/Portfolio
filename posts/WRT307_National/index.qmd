To the [Human Trafficking Institute](https://traffickinginstitute.org/)

I am an Army ROTC cadet in my senior year at Syracuse University and I am writing to advocate for stronger education on human trafficking for ROTC cadets and to explore opportunities for partnership between the Human Trafficking Institute (HTI) and Syracuse University. As ROTC cadets we will soon begin our careers as leaders where we will be entrusted with the lives and well-being of our soldiers, and it is imperative that we are prepared to recognize, respond to, and lead efforts that combat human trafficking in all its forms.

Human trafficking is not confined to the United States, it is a parasite that thrives where leaders lack the awareness and tools to intervene. Being at the beginning of our careers, this early exposure and education will help us in safeguarding vulnerable populations in addition to equipping us with the ability to instill the same awareness and vigilance into the soldiers we lead. By incorporating trafficking awareness and response into our curriculum we can ensure that our Army leaders will be prepared to combat traffickers and their effort both in the United States and abroad.

HTI’s mission of decimating human trafficking by stopping it through law enforcement aligns with the army values of fighting all enemies, foreign and domestic. By establishing a connection with Syracuse University, HTI has the opportunity to empower future leaders to carry on the mission of building a future where traffickers are afraid not only in the U.S. but anywhere in the world. Together, I propose initiatives such as guest lectures (in person or via zoom) or workshops that provide actionable steps and tools for identifying trafficking and engagement with the broader Syracuse student body, especially the Student Veteran Organization (SVO), an upstanding and driven community that would bring valuable skills to any organization, especially HTI.

This partnership would be invaluable to not only Syracuse ROTC cadets and students but also HTI. By working with Syracuse University HTI will cultivate a community of impassioned leaders and professionals who will amplify HTI’s impact by bringing awareness and tools to several careers spanning from lawyers to sports management.

My passion for working against human trafficking is recent and with that I recognize the need for more expert voices, such as those at HTI. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with you. Thank you for your time and commitment to service.

Respectfully,

Nick Robison
